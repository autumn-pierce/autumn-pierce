- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Autumn Gwendolyn Pierce, aka @autumn-pierce on Github! I am a front end generalist, hoping to land a job in UI/UX dev. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in granular synthesis, guitar pedals, DAW frontend, and UI/UX development. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning evertything to do with front end development. I started out in web dev, learning HTML CSS and Typescript alongside Figma and Illustrator for drafting up wireframes.
      However, I have recently begun development on a series of FM sythesizers, written in C++ with the JUCE framework. My end goal is to use my front end skills to create a full VST top to bottom.
